                        The story describes an account of the "Second Impact". In 2000 AD, a huge meteorite fell near the Antarctic iceberg (according to the government). The high temperature caused some of the ice to melt, which also caused the global water level to rise.
                         The following natural and man-made disasters were even more continuous. In 2015, a new invader appeared, a huge human-like mechanical battle group. People called them "apostles", probably implying that they were messengers sent by God. , come and destroy the evil-doing human beings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The various military weapons of mankind at the moment are useless against the apostles. For this reason, the political center of the earth at that time decided to reuse the organization NERV. They used the most sophisticated technology to
                         A huge amount of money was spent to develop a "general-purpose humanoid decisive weapon" that is directly controlled by the driver's nerves. This high-tech product precisely integrates the driver and the machine, and controls the EVA through will and body reactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, because these technologies were still in the research and development stage at the time, there were many obstacles that could not be overcome immediately. And because not everyone can drive EVA freely. Driver candidates have always been the biggest headache for NERV. Not only is it difficult to find qualified people, but it also requires several months of training to achieve the basic ability to synchronize activities with EVA.
                         Then, three boys and girls were discovered in the world who could drive EVA, and people placed their hopes on them.

                    "Neon Genesis Evangelion" started out as a typical robot animation, with the story focusing on describing battle scenes and character dialogue. As the plot progresses, the story gradually turns into a psychoanalytic narrative of the characters' inner world, and this feature is brought into full play especially in the ending chapters. In this film, the revolutionary strong stream-of-consciousness technique and the use of a large number of religious and philosophical images caused it to have a huge reverberation and impact in Japan, which was called a "social phenomenon", and became a milestone in the history of Japanese animation. Many anime watchers often regard it as one of the greatest animations in history.

                <p>
                    It has the power to penetrate deeply into people's hearts. In the dilemma of differentiation and confusion, it can find light and hope, and explore the source of strength in everyone's own heart. That's why this classic continues to appeal. The work's discussion of human nature and the characters' inner confusion, struggle, struggle and effort, as well as the sense of existence, have played a positive and positive role in the hearts and even the lives of most readers. This kind of influence beyond animation is exactly what is worth looking forward to.
